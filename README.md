☁️ Weather Checker (Python)
This is a simple weather information app built using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. It fetches real-time weather data based on the city name entered by the user and displays the temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

🌍 What It Does
Takes a city name as input from the user

Connects to the OpenWeatherMap API

Fetches and displays:

Current temperature (in Celsius)

Humidity percentage

Weather condition (like clear sky, rain, etc.)

Handles errors like invalid city names or connection failures

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

Internet connection

A free OpenWeatherMap API key

🧾 How It Works
The user is prompted to enter a city name.

The program sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided city and API key.

If the city is valid and the request is successful, the weather information is displayed.

If not, the user is informed that the city wasn’t found.

🔐 API Key Note
To use this project, you’ll need to:

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap.org

Generate a free API key from your account

Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own

💡 Future Enhancements
Display more weather details like wind speed, sunrise/sunset times, etc.

Add a GUI or build a web app version

Store search history

Add error handling for connection issues
